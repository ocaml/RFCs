# Rows and Subtyping

This sub-track of the high-road type-checker design deals with row
polymorphism and subtyping. In particular, that means:

  - Object types
  - Polymorphic variant types
  - Algebraic effects

### Open questions

  - What form(s) of row polymorphism should we use?

  - Can we use a single underlying implementation for all three language features?

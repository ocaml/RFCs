Gabriel Radanne will start doing more code reviews now.

Reviews: hmm.

  It would be nice if all Inferno-working people could help on code
  reviews, not only within their subgroups.

 (the idea of in-person presentations for big PRs: Leo is not in
 favor, unconvinced by the idea of travelling to Paris so often (too
 many big PRs?))

Low road: the point is that making the code easier to understand
  is a compiler-distribution feature by itself.

Leo: larger rewrites should get RFCs just as big high-road features.

Testing?
  - Leo: Jane Street will keep building a branch of their codebase in trunk
  - opamcheck: if we suspect there is a regression risk, we try to convince
    Florian to run opamcheck on it

High-road testing? Can we collect important examples of tricky OCaml
code that relies on sharing in deep ways?

Pierre Chambart: if we had a shared typed IR it would be easier for testing.

Testing: collect examples of things that do not work in the testsuite,
corresponding to known defects. "known-to-break" testsuite directory?

  Policy: Everytime there is a new bug report with a small repro-test,
  it should go into this known-defects directory.

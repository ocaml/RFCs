Tentative schedule for this research meeting

Suggestions by Jacques:
* discuss the framework for changes in the typechecker / type system, particularly whether to go for a low road / high road approach (see notes of previous meeting)
* technical discussions on the type system and its implementation

Suggestions by Fran√ßois:

* discuss the low road (trying to set up a concrete lists of things
  to do and people who can do them)

* discuss the high road (with similar aims)

* discuss the idea of introducing one or more explicitly typed
  languages (equipped with reference type-checkers that perform
  no type inference)
  
Suggestions by Leo:

* Discuss the aims of the rewriting project

* Discuss how we want to collaborate on the typechecker, i.e. how should we communicate and how should we make decisions

* Discuss how we are going to track/report progress on the various lines of work

* Try to write down some kind of plan/schedule of work
